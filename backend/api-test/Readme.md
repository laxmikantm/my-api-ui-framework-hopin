#### Option2

a) From commandline invoke `mvn clean test` 

### Note:

1) The Test Runner will create Cucumber report at below folder `target/cucumber-html-report`

2) Also, a interactive Donut report will be created in ${project.build.directory}/donut
Command: `mvn clean integration-test generate` * Note: This plugin might need some local customisation.

3) Logs will be generated under /log folder present under root directory

## Future Improvements Planned

1) Modularise Wiremock functionality.
2) Add more granular assertions
